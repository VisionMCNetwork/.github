# VisionMC
VisionMC was an upcoming Practice server that changed practice as we knew it.

- We offered many exclusive features such as
  - Staff were active within the community 🫂
  - Listened to feedback and implemented user suggested changes 🎉
  - The first mainstream server to offer Modern Practice 🆕
  - The first mainstream server to implement a 1:1 copy of MMC Knockback ⚔️
  - The first mainstream server to truly put content creators first 🎥

### We now wish to open source some of our assets in order to help people make servers that will empower the 1.8 community

#### SpigotV - An Optimized SpigotX fork with vulnrabilities patched and has general bug fixes. Includes a mid clone of 2021 MMC knockback.
